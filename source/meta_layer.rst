Meta Layer
==========

A Yocto/OpenEmbedded meta-layer is a directory that contains recipes, configuration files, patches, etc., all needed by
*Bitbake* to properly "see" and build a BSP, a distribution, a (set of) package(s), whatever.
Several meta-layers are provided by Freescale for the SABRE Board.

Please, refer to the software documentation on the `Freescale SDK website <http://www.freescale.com/infocenter/index.jsp?topic=%2FQORIQSDK%2F2880375.html>`_
